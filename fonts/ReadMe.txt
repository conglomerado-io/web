Spacedock Stencil is a font I assumed already existed - a stencilized, slightly stressed adaptation of a classic typeface that has long been associated with space-adventure fiction (used for signage in Space: 1999, the Star Trek films, and many others). I searched up and down for a long time, and while I encountered the occasional mock-up of stencils using this style, they were always individual works of graphic design, where somebody stencilized-and-stressed the thing by hand in a paint program.

So, I decided to stencilize-and-stress the entire keyboard set (plus some of my usual extras, like smartquotes and true dashes and things) all at once, so I'd never have to do it again!

I hemmed and hawwed over how much stressing to add ... did I want a flaked-paint look? A rusted-and-corroded look? A painted-by-an-idiot-not-competent-to-handle-a-paint-sprayer look? In the end, I went for very mild stressing - just a few random touches and a mild bloat to the edges, to give it a hasty but not *ruined* appearance, since added stressing is much easier to do later on than the rest. The final result is one I'm pleased with: an original font that hearkens back to an old favorite, and one that I'll find useful in upcoming Points in Space installments! Enjoy.
